# Introduction

Taz: Wanted was a game I had on PC when I was alot younger, and with PC's these days not having any CD Drive, there is no way to play these old games unless they are re released on a platform like [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/). Nowadays you can easily download nocd cracks, where these checks have already been patched out of the executable, but that's no fun, lets try to find out how to create our own no CD patch.

## CD Check

Once I've finished installing Taz: Wanted when trying to run it, it presents with the below screen, prompting to insert the Taz: Wanted CD-ROM into our CD Drive.

## Analysis

Let's find out how this check is being performed. Quick Googling around, old forum posts mention how games would just check for a CD-ROM drive on the PC, with a disk inserted that has a `string` of the game as the label. We will open the Taz.exe file open in [Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/) and see if we can find out if this CD-ROM check is done the same.

Once the executable is open in Ghidra, we will want to use all Analyzers and let it analyse.

My first thought is, if it is just checking if there is a CD Drive on the PC, and then checks if the Label of the CD-Drive is equal to something, I should check libraries that the executable imports.

Under kernel32.dll I see that `GetDriveTypeA` and `GetVolumeInformationA` are referenced in the executable, and they are only ever referenced once, is this possibly the function that checks the CD-ROM and is the "copy protection"?

If I go to this reference, I can see in the decompiled view below.

At first glance, I can see that `GetDriveTypeA` is being assigned a variable, and is then being compared to the value `5`. 
`UVar2 = GetDriveTypeA((LPCSTR)local_138);`

`if ((UVar2 == 5)`

Looking at the documentation for the function [GetDriveTypeA](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-getdrivetypea) we see that a return value of 5, means the drive is a CD-ROM drive. Looks like we have where our check is done.

Looking further down this function, we can see references to a string in the executable `TazWanted` as well as `CD Found\n`. This gives us further confirmation that this is the function checking that a CD-ROM drive is present, and a CD is inserted that has the label `TazWanted`.

If `bVar8` is not 0, it then returns what looks to be a non 0 value. We can safely rename this `FUN_004a1f10` to `CD_CHECK`. With this we can check what is actually calling `CD_CHECK` and see if we can just skip calling this CD-ROM function altogether. By showing all references of this `CD_CHECK` we can see that it's mentioned 3 times by 1 other function `FUN_004a1de0`. Let's jump to this function.

We can see that it assigns `uVar2 = CD_CHECK();` a variable to the returned result. It then just does a return at the end if a simple condition is met with the returned result of `CD_CHECK`.

If we just return out of this function before the CD_CHECK does the game continue on as usual? Let's patch this `CALL CD_CHECK` and change it to just a `RET`, then save and export this executable and replace the Taz.exe in the `C:\Program Files (x86)\Infogrames Interactive\TazWanted` directory and test it out.

## Successs!

The game launches to the main menu now, doesn't prompt to enter our Taz: Wanted CD-ROM and we can now play the game!

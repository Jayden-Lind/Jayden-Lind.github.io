<p>Azure is an interesting platform, and I wanted to see what it is like to connect a device on my private network to Azure's Private network, if for example I was to set up replication, or Azure Backup etc.</p>
<p>Below is the steps that I took to get it up and running on my Hyper-V 2019 host.</p>
<ol><li>On the Virtual Network, created separate gateway subnet to attach the Virtual Gateway to.<br></li></ol>

<p>2. Head to the Virtual Network Gateway you created, then click Point-to-site configuration. Add a IP range that the site will connect to.</p>

<p>3. On the client ie. My Hyper-V host, need to run the below in a elevated Powershell prompt. <strong>NOTE</strong> Don't close the Powershell prompt <br> <br> $cert = New-SelfSignedCertificate -Type Custom -KeySpec Signature ` -Subject "CN=AzureVPN" -KeyExportPolicy Exportable ` -HashAlgorithm sha256 -KeyLength 2048 ` -CertStoreLocation "Cert:\CurrentUser\My" -KeyUsageProperty Sign -KeyUsage CertSign <br><br>This will create the cert you can use for the VPN.<br>Now to create the Client cert run the below.<br><br> New-SelfSignedCertificate -Type Custom -DnsName P2SChildCert -KeySpec Signature ` -Subject "CN=AzureVPNClient" -KeyExportPolicy Exportable ` -HashAlgorithm sha256 -KeyLength 2048 ` -CertStoreLocation "Cert:\CurrentUser\My" ` -Signer $cert -TextExtension @("2.5.29.37={text}1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.2") <br></p>

<p>Once you can see the cert in Current User -&gt; Persoanl -&gt; Cetificates, right click on the AzureVPN certificate, and go All Tasks -&gt; Export.</p>

<p>Export it where ever is easiest for you, IE Desktop.<br>Now open the certificate in Notepad</p>

![image](/img/image-17.png)
<p>Copy all of the certificate and head back to the virtual gateway on the Azure Portal.<br>You will need to enter as below, except pasting your own certificate.</p>

<p>Make sure to save this configuration, and do note this can take some time.<br>Once the configuration is saved, click Download VPN client. Extract the zip. Once you have extracted the ZIP head to "WindowsAmd64/VpnClientSetupAmd64.exe" and run.<br>Click Yes to installing the VPN Client.<br>If you check in Network Adapters, you will see a WAN Miniport connection. Click connect and you will be prompted with this.</p>

<p>Click Connect again and you will be connected to your Virtual Network hosted in Azure!<br><br>We can confirm this by first trying to RDP into my virtual machine that is hosted in Azure.<br>As you can see, my VM in Azure has a private IP 10.0.0.4</p>

<p>And there we go, we are now connected our Azure Virtual Network from our Hyper-V host!</p>
